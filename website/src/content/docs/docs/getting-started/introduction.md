# Welcome to Fabr

Fabr is a straightforward command-line tool that helps you quickly start new projects using templates. Whether you're setting up a React app, a Node.js server, or any other type of project, fabr makes it easy to get up and running in seconds.

## What is Fabr?

Fabr (short for "fabricate") takes the pain out of project setup by letting you:

- **Scaffold projects instantly** - No more copying and pasting boilerplate code
- **Use community templates** - Access templates created by other developers
- **Create your own templates** - Share your favorite project setups with others
- **Customize everything** - Replace placeholders and configure projects during setup

## How It Works

Fabr supports two types of templates:

### File-Based Templates

Traditional templates that copy files from a repository and replace placeholders like `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` with your values.

### Command-Based Templates

Execute shell commands to set up projects programmatically - perfect for CLI tools like `create-react-app` or `npm init`.

## Why Use Fabr?

- **Simple** - Just one command to create a new project
- **Flexible** - Works with any programming language or framework
- **Customizable** - Configure projects with placeholders and environment variables
- **Fast** - Get from idea to coding in seconds, not minutes
